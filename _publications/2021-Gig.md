Artificial intelligence (AI) has been increasingly integrated in the process of matching between workers and employers requesting 
job tasks on a gig-economy platform. Unlike the conventional wisdom that adopting AI in the matching process always benefits the platform 
by assigning better-matched jobs (employers) to workers, we, however, discover unintended but possible revenue-decreasing consequences for 
the AI-adopting platform. We build a stylized game-theoretical model that considers gig workers' strategic participation behavior. 
We find that while the matching enhancement effect of AI can increase the platform's revenue by improving matching quality, 
AI-assigned jobs can also reveal information about the uncertain labor demand to workers and thus change workers' participation 
decision in an unfavorable way, resulting in revenue loss for the platform. We extend our model to the cases where (1) the share of 
revenue between workers and platform is endogenous and (2) the workers compete for the job tasks,  
and find consistent results. Furthermore, we examine two approaches to mitigate the potential negative effect of AI-enabled matching for 
the platform and find that under certain conditions, the AI-adopting platform can be better off by truthfully revealing the labor demand or competition 
information to workers. Our results shed light on both the intended positive and unintended negative roles of utilizing AI to facilitate matching, 
and highlight the importance for thoughtful development, management, and application of AI in the gig economy.
