Abstract
---
In practice, interest expense can account for a large proportion of firms’ costs, while the
interest rate is often influenced by a firm’s market prospect. In the presence of information
asymmetry, a firm may have an incentive to borrow a larger amount, thereby signaling a high
prospect to the lenders. On the other hand, such market confidence, if publicly shown, may
stimulate competitors to respond more aggressively, which may incentivize the firm to instead
borrow a smaller amount. Motivated by such observations, we investigate the determinants
of a firm’s financing and information revelation strategy. First, under public financing where
the borrowing information is openly accessible, we find that when the firm’s internal capital
level and the market competition intensity are both low, the firm over-finances, if the market
prospect is high, so as to credibly reveal its information to lower the interest rate. On the
contrary, when the firm’s internal capital level and the competition intensity are both high,
the firm under-finances, if the market prospect is low, to credibly signal its information to
alleviate competition. In the remaining scenarios, these two averse incentives are surprisingly
neutralized–the firm neither imitates nor signals–and the first-best solution is attained. As such,
rather counter-intuitively, we show that an increase of the internal capital level can sometimes
even be harmful for the firm while benefiting the competitor, and a more competitive market
may not always be detrimental. Second, we investigate when the firm may seek private financing
so that the borrowing information is not publicly revealed. A classical signaling game arises
between the firm and the lender, while the competitor relies on the prior information to make
its response. We find that private financing emerges as an equilibrium outcome only when the
firm’s internal capital level is sufficiently high and the competition intensity is intermediate.
