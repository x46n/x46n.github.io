Abstract

Problem definition: This paper examines the economic effects of the fulfillment services
offered by Amazon (FBA) to the third-party sellers on its retail platform. Academic/Practical
relevance: Logistics is critical for e-commerce. It is intriguing that the third-party sellers that
use FBA may directly compete with Amazon (Amazon 2018). By FBA, their service levels
are substantially improved, and so is their competitiveness. Such a phenomenon has been little
investigated in prior literature. Methodology: We develop a strategic competition model where
Amazon and a representative third-party seller engage in both price and service competition.
Results: Interestingly, we find that although FBA may intensify the service competition between
Amazon and the third-party sellers, it can mitigate their price competition besides the direct
revenue Amazon collects from the services. The latter effects dominate the former when the
cross-service sensitivity of the consumers is either sufficiently low or sufficiently high. Therefore,
not only the third-party sellers but also Amazon may benefit from FBA. Moreover, since the
sales of Amazon’s products may increase due to FBA, its OEM supplier may gain from FBA too.
These findings extend to the settings where the third-party seller is Amazon’s OEM supplier,
cross-price and cross-service sensitivities are correlated, or the parties set their retail prices
sequentially. Managerial implications: Our analysis provides insights about when FBA is
more likely to be beneficial and when it can be harmful. They are useful for understanding the
impacts of FBA on both Amazon and the third-party sellers.
